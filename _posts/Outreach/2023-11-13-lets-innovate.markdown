Interested in hearing a judges perspective on science and innovation fairs? I joined Paul Tiege with host Michael Unger to discuss what we as judges look for, particularly as we approach the semi-finals and finals of the Youth Innovation Showcase, a science fair centred around innovations brought to us by the incredibly thoughtful youth of British Columbia!
