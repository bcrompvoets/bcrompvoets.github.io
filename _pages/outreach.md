Astronomy is absolutely beautiful, and it is one of my many joys to impress this upon the public! Below are some of my recent outreach events. If you are interested in having an astronomer come talk to your class, please feel free to email me and we can arrange either an in-person (if your school is in the Victoria area) or virtual visit. I am a registered volunteer with the <a href="https://centreoftheuniverse.org/for-educators">CanYES</a> program, bringing astronomers to have informal chats with students in grades 4-12. Furthermore, I'm happy to give talks on the following subjects:
<ul>
  <li>Star Formation</li>
  <li>The Life Cycle of Stars</li>
  <li>Astrobiology: From Warm Little Ponds to Life on Earth</li>
  <li>Why Pluto is No Longer a Planet</li>
  <li>How Big is Space Really?</li>
</ul>
