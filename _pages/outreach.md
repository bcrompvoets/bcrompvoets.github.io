It is one of my many pleasures to engage with the public about science and astronomy. Below are some links to examples of recent outreach events. If you are interested in having an astronomer come talk to your class, please feel free to email me and we can arrange either an in-person (if your school is in the Victoria BC or Regina SK areas) or virtual visit. I am also a registered volunteer with the <a href="https://centreoftheuniverse.org/for-educators">CanYES</a> program, bringing astronomers to have informal chats with students in grades 4-12. I'm happy to give talks on the following subjects:
<ul>
  <li>Star Formation: How to Bake a Star</li>
  <li>The Life Cycle of Stars</li>
  <li>Astrobiology: From Warm Little Ponds to Life on Earth</li>
  <li>Why Pluto is No Longer a Planet</li>
  <li>How Big is Space Really?</li>
</ul>
