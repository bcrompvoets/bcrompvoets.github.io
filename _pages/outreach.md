Astronomy is absolutely beautiful, and it is one of my many joys to impress this upon the public! If you are a grade school teacher, please feel free to email me and we can arrange either an in-person (if your school is in the Victoria area) or virtual visit. I was able to give 6 separate talks to elementary school classes before the UVic Speakers Bureau program ended. I'm happy to give talks on the following subjects:
<ul>
  <li>Star Formation</li>
  <li>The Life Cycle of Stars</li>
  <li>From Warm Little Ponds to Life on Earth</li>
  <li>Why Pluto is No Longer a Planet</li>
</ul>
