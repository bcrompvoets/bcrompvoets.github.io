Hello! I am happy to see you've stumbled upon my page! I'm a PhD student studying under Dr. James Dr Francesco. Specifically, my research focuses on the utilization of different machine learning models to identify Young Stellar Objects in James Webb Space Telescope data, and from there to learn more about the impact of environoments on star formation.

If you were looking for an English description: I use AI to find patterns in pictures taken by our latest space telescope, with the aim of identifying stars that are just in the midst of being born! From looking at where these stars are and what's all going on around them (for instance how many other newborn stars are around and how much dust is present), we can learn what limits the formation of stars on a fundamental level!

I am very excited to share what I have learned, and you can find a catalogue of my recent outreach talks under the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/outreach/">Outreach</a> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">tab</a>.
