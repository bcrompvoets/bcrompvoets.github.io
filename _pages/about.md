Hello! I am happy to see you've stumbled upon my page! I'm a PhD student studying under <a href="https://www.jamesdifrancesco.com">Dr. James Di Francesco</a>. Specifically, my research focuses on the utilization of different machine learning models to identify Young Stellar Objects in James Webb Space Telescope data, and from there to learn more about the impact of environoments on star formation. We analyze not only column density, but how the method of star formation (triggered vs quiescent) impacts the number and type of YSOs formed.

My Masters research focused on a case study of the Cosmic Cliffs, the region released as part of the Early Release Observations of JWST in July of 2022 (see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/publications">Publications</a> for more information on that particular work). My PhD aims to apply these methods to several different Galactic star-forming regions imaged by JWST, and to delve further into revealed trends.
