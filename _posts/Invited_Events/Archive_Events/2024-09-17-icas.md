It is my pleasure to virtually join the Island County Astronomical Society tonight to chat about star formation in the era of JWST. In particular, we'll be chatting about how exactly stars are formed, and going on to examine the assumptions we make as we explore this process, and finally how the James Webb Space Telescope is shedding new light on this part of astronomical research.

The Island County Astronomical Society is composed of a group of amateur astronomers from across Washington State, includingfrom the Skagit, Snohomish, and Island Counties, as well as their virtual meeting format opening the Society up to members from beyond the state. They host monthly star parties, and engage with local schools and civic groups across their respective counties.
