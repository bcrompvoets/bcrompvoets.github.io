The Deep Sky IMAX movie tells the story of the tenuous steps to getting the James Webb Space Telescope into space, and hinted at the beautiful science it has finally made possible. Chris Wilott, Dori Blakely, and I, were invited to speak as panellists at the Royal British Columbia Museum following their special showing of Deep Sky. The theatre was sold out, and even after the question period ended people came up to us with more they wanted to know. A beautful night and a beautiful movie!
