The Friends of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory host weekly Star Parties all summer long at the Centre of the Universe in Victoria, BC. On August 17th, 2024, I'll be joining them to speak on how stars form, and in particular, how the new James Webb Space Telescope is changing our understanding of this process. At every Star Party there are tours, talks, and multiple telescopes with astronomers and volunteers to show you all the interesting things the night sky in Victoria has to offer!
