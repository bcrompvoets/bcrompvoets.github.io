Below is a list of current refereed publications I am an author on. Asterixes indicate I am the first author.

I have worked alongside the <a href="http://www.ossos-survey.org">Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS)</a> team in evaluating the distribution of objects in the Trans-Neptunian belt, and the associated paper can be found under the "OSSOS" tab. Similarly, the works related to my current research on star formation in the era of JWST can be found under the "SF - JWST" tab.
