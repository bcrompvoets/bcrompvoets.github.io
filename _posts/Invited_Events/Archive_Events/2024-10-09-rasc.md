It is my pleasure to join the Victoria Chapter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) tonight at the University of Victoria (BWC A104)  to chat about star formation in the era of JWST. In particular, we'll be chatting about how exactly stars are formed, and going on to examine the assumptions we make as we explore this process, and finally how the James Webb Space Telescope is shedding new light on this part of astronomical research.

The RASC is a country-wide society composed of amateur astronomers (the word amateur comes from the latin word *amare* which means "to love"). Along with monthly meetings, different subsets of the Victoria chapter  meet often throughout the month, with meetings related to astrophotography, astronomy-related builds, and more. They further host yearly star parties in Cowichan Valley, participate as volunteers with the weekly summer star parties at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, as well as other special events. I highly encourage you to check out their webpage to see all of the exciting things going on!
